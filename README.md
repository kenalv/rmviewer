### Installing

#### Front-end Installation ####

* Node.js **set-up**:
    Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.

    1. To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.

    2. If you dont have Node.js installed go to [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* Angular **set-up**:
    Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as **npm packages**. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager. 

    1. Install the Angular CLI, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:
        ``` npm install -g @angular/cli ```

    2. Open project's  frontend/kayakdemo folder and run the following command:
        ``` npm install ```

        NOTE:
        > This command will install all the node packages used on the app. 
        You may wait few mins to finish packages installation.

    3. Serve the application.
        On frontend/kayakdemo folder, open terminal/console and run  the following command:
        ``` ng serve --open ```

        NOTE:
        >The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/.
